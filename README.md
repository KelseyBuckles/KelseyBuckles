- 👋 Hi, I’m @KelseyBuckles.
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning applications in modal analysis and slosh dynamics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, refining my Python skills, and have Scala and Spark next up on my list of languages to learn.
- 💞️ Outside of work I’m looking to collaborate on ML to assist in cold cases and missing person location.
- 📫 You can reach me at Kelsey.D.Buckles@nasa.gov.
